# Anti-Racist Daily Actions

A simple, practical desk reminder for incorporating anti-racist practices into your daily life. Whether you're new to anti-racist work or continuing a lifelong journey, these reminders offer accessible ways to stay engaged, self-aware, and accountable.

## 📄 Overview

**Anti-Racist Daily Actions** provides a list of reflective and actionable steps to help individuals:

🌱 **Self-Educate** – Read, watch, and listen to news and stories covering systemic racism, privilege, and history. Stay updated on current events in race and justice movements. Seek out voices from marginalized communities. Listen, don’t just observe.

🧠 **Unlearn Bias** – Check your own biases in how you think, speak, and act. Ask ‘Where did this belief come from?’ and ‘Who benefits from it?’. Challenge internalized ideas about race, beauty, professionalism, and beyond.

📢 **Speak Up** – Call out racist jokes, slurs, or stereotypes. Silence is being complict when someone’s being harmed by racism. Use privilege to amplify marginalized voices, don’t overshadow them.

✊ **Support BIPOC** – Make conscious choices in spending, reading, and media consumption to support Black, Indigenous, and People of Color. Promote their work and elevate their platforms.

💬 **Be Honest** – Talk about race with friends, family, and coworkers even when it’s uncomfortable. Encourage others to explore biases and challenge systemic racism.

⚖️ **Confront Injustice** – Question policies and practices at work, school, and community groups that exclude or harm marginalized people. Advocate for change in hiring, education, policing, and more.

🧩 **Acknowledge** – Understand how race intersects with gender, class, disability, and sexuality. Anti-racists must also address other forms of oppression. Practice intersectionality.

👂 **Listen** – If someone calls you out, listen. Don’t get defensive. Learn, apologize, reflect, and change behavior moving forward. Be open to criticism.

Being anti-racist is a lifelong pursuit. Keep showing up.
